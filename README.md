## 🏷️ Project Title
**CoreID** – A Decentralized Identity (DID) System built on the Core DAO blockchain.

---

## 🧾 Project Description

CoreID is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to create, store, and verify digital identities on-chain. Powered by Core DAO's Bitcoin-level security and EVM compatibility, CoreID ensures that identity information is immutable, verifiable, and securely stored with user sovereignty in mind.

Users can register their identities, attach verified documents (like KYC and academic certificates) via IPFS, and link social media handles. An admin-based verification system ensures trust and transparency for third-party dApps and services that rely on identity authentication.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The vision behind CoreID is to empower individuals with control over their digital identities by eliminating centralized gatekeepers. It aims to become the foundation of secure Web3 identity verification, enabling access to services such as DeFi platforms, education records, hiring portals, and government registries—all while ensuring privacy and ownership for users.

CoreID strives to:
- Replace siloed, centralized ID systems with a trustless, user-owned solution.
- Support interoperable identities across dApps and chains.
- Contribute to the growing decentralized identity ecosystem in the Core DAO network.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 🔗 **Cross-Chain Identity Syncing:** Integrate identity bridging across Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain.
- 📲 **Mobile App Integration:** Enable mobile registration and QR-based identity verification.
- 🧠 **AI-based Verification Assistant:** Automate document and metadata analysis.
- 🏛️ **DAO-Driven Verification:** Let the community vote on verifying identities for greater decentralization.
- 🛡️ **ZK Proof Integration:** Enable selective disclosure of information using zero-knowledge proofs.
- 🧾 **Integration with Government/Enterprise Records:** Enable verifiable academic or employment credentials.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **On-Chain Identity Registration:** Users register their name, email, and metadata directly on the blockchain.
- 🔐 **Admin-Based Verification:** Admins can verify or revoke identity status for authenticity.
- 🌐 **Metadata Linking:** Attach KYC docs, degrees, or resumes stored on IPFS.
- 🧬 **Social Identity Integration:** Link Web2 identifiers like Twitter, GitHub, or LinkedIn.
- 📡 **Immutable and Transparent:** Every action is logged and verifiable on the Core DAO chain.
- 🧾 **Event Logs for Frontend Integration:** Easily connect to frontend dApps using emitted logs and smart contract reads.
